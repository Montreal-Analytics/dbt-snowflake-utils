# 2-Step dbt Cloning Pattern

Credit: [This cloning pattern is inspired by Dan Goodenâ€™s article here from the Airtasker Tribe blog.](https://medium.com/airtribe/test-sql-pipelines-against-production-clones-using-dbt-and-snowflake-2f8293722dd4) 

Cloning is a cost- and time-efficient way of developing dbt models on Snowflake but it can be challenging when your cloning needs traverse different environments with different access controls: i.e. you want to clone a production database for use in development. 

A solution for this is to run a 2-step cloning pattern:

1. A production role clones the production database or schema and then changes the ownership of that clone object to a developer role, thus creating a developer clone of production.
2. Developer users use the developer role to clone that developer clone database or schema, thus creating a new personal developer clone for development.

This pattern can be used for cloning a schema or a database. If all the dbt models are stored within a single schema, schema-level cloning is a good option. When dbt is configured to write data to multiple schemata, database-level cloning is a good, more production-like option.

This patterns optimizes for the following:

- **Access Control:** no need to compromise on your access control system, such as by allowing your developer role to have extensive access on production. This pattern takes environmental separation as a given.
- **Flexible Availability:** step 1 can be run on any preferred schedule: the developer clone could be updated hourly, daily, weekly, or any other cadence. This first clone is ideally run after a complete execution of dbt for the freshest data possible.
- **Developer Flexibility:** developers can take personal clones whenever they need to and can even take multiple clones if they have need of more than one concurrent development environment. These developer clones are ideally commonly rotated to keep data fresh and production-like.

## Setup:

1. Update one of your production jobs to include step 1 of the cloning pattern. Here is an example implementation for database-level cloning from produciton to production_clone:
    
    ```bash
    dbt build &&
    dbt run-operation clone_database_with_new_owner \
      --args "{'new_owner_role': 'developer_role', 'source_database': 'production', 'destination_database': 'production_clone'}"
    ```
    
2. As needed, locally run step 2 of the cloning pattern to create or update personal development clones. Here is an example implementation for database-level cloning from productino_clone to an ephemeral database called developer_clone_me:
    
    ```bash
    dbt run-operation clone_database \
      --args "{'source_database': 'production_clone', 'destination_database': 'developer_clone_me'}"
    ```
