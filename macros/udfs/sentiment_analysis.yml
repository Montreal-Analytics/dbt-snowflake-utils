    description: "
      This macro iterates through a piece of text to return the overall 
      sentiment of that text. 
      First, the macro pre-processes the text removing unnecessary punctuation
      and stopwords to help increase the accuracy of the model. Subsequently, using
      the transformers library it applies a sentiment analysis pipeline based on a 
      pre-trained model that will return either a score or a label for the text.
      Recommendation is to use the following popular models:
      1. cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest:
          (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)
          This model is trained on 124M tweets from January 2018 to December 2021,
          and is finetuned for sentiment analysis.
          It outputs a label - Neutral, Positive or Negative - and a score ranging
          from 0 to 1 - 0 being the most negative and 1, the most positive.
      2. nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment:
          (https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment)
          This model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews in six 
          languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian. It outputs
          a label - 1 to 5 stars - and a score ranging from 0 to 1 - 0 being the
          most negative and 1, the most positive.
